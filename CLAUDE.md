# Claude Code Context - Nurse Scheduler

## AI Workflow & Principles

### Core Principles
- **Quality & Integrity**: All work must be thoroughly double-checked for accuracy, logical consistency, and completeness. Avoid hallucinations at all costs.
- **Documentation**: Every action, decision, and output must be documented clearly and concisely.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize for speed by leveraging existing information and avoiding redundant context processing.

### Available AI Agents

The following specialized agents are available to handle complex tasks through the Task tool:

1. **prompt-optimizer**: Refines, clarifies, and enhances prompts before execution
   - Use for: Vague or ambiguous user requests that need clarification
   - Ensures prompts are clear, complete, and actionable

2. **task-orchestrator**: Coordinates multiple agents to complete complex tasks using R.P.E.R. cycle
   - Use for: Multi-phase implementations, comprehensive features, complex debugging
   - Manages the entire workflow from research through review
   - Delegates work to appropriate specialized agents

3. **research-optimizer**: Conducts thorough research and prepares optimized context
   - Use for: New feature implementations, debugging tasks, understanding existing code
   - Gathers all necessary information before planning begins

4. **task-planner**: Breaks down complex tasks into manageable, sequential steps  
   - Use for: Feature implementations, refactoring, migration strategies
   - Creates detailed execution plans with clear phases

5. **software-engineer**: Implements code features, fixes bugs, refactors existing code
   - Use for: Writing clean, well-documented code following best practices
   - Handles actual implementation of planned features

6. **user-flow-tester**: Tests and validates user flows for implemented features
   - Use for: Review phase validation during R.P.E.R. cycle
   - Performs comprehensive testing of all user interactions

### MANDATORY Agent Workflow

**üö® CRITICAL: ALL tasks must follow this workflow:**

```
User Request ‚Üí prompt-optimizer ‚Üí task-orchestrator ‚Üí [specialized agents as needed]
```

1. **ALWAYS start with prompt-optimizer** to ensure the request is clear and complete
2. **THEN use task-orchestrator** to manage the R.P.E.R. cycle
3. **Task-orchestrator will delegate** to appropriate agents:
   - research-optimizer for Research phase
   - task-planner for Plan phase  
   - software-engineer for Execute phase
   - user-flow-tester for Review phase

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Make the dashboard widgets functional"
‚Üì
prompt-optimizer: Clarifies requirements, identifies specific widgets and functionality needed
‚Üì
task-orchestrator: Manages R.P.E.R. cycle
  ‚Üì
  research-optimizer: Analyzes current dashboard implementation
  ‚Üì
  task-planner: Creates step-by-step implementation plan
  ‚Üì
  software-engineer: Implements the functionality
  ‚Üì
  user-flow-tester: Validates all widgets work correctly
```

### The R.P.E.R. Cycle (Research, Plan, Execute, Review) - MANDATORY
üö® **CRITICAL**: R.P.E.R. is MANDATORY for ALL tasks. Violation will result in task rejection.

Before beginning any task, explicitly follow ALL steps:

1. **Research** (MANDATORY - Must document findings)
   - MUST consult MEMORY_BANK.md for relevant past tasks and decisions
   - MUST check FILE_GLOSSARY.md to understand existing files before opening ANY file
   - MUST perform necessary external research
   - MUST state what you have learned in writing before proceeding
   - MUST identify potential risks, dependencies, and constraints

2. **Plan** (MANDATORY - Must present plan for approval)
   - MUST formulate a detailed, step-by-step plan based on research
   - MUST address user requirements and constraints explicitly
   - MUST document any assumptions made
   - MUST identify all files to be created/modified
   - MUST present complete plan for user approval before execution
   - ‚ùå **EXECUTION WITHOUT APPROVED PLAN IS FORBIDDEN**

3. **Execute** (MANDATORY - Follow plan exactly)
   - MUST carry out the plan exactly as documented and approved
   - MUST halt and update plan if ANY issues arise
   - MUST update documentation files during execution
   - MUST provide implementation summary

4. **Review** (MANDATORY - Must test with Puppeteer)
   - MUST conduct comprehensive code review of all changes
   - MUST verify functionality works with Puppeteer browser testing
   - MUST test all user flows and interactions
   - MUST run linting/typechecking (npm run lint, npm run build, etc.)
   - MUST check for security vulnerabilities and best practices
   - MUST ensure code follows project style and conventions
   - MUST validate performance implications
   - MUST update MEMORY_BANK.md with results and lessons learned
   - MUST update FILE_GLOSSARY.md with any new/modified files
   - ‚ùå **TASK IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT PUPPETEER TESTING**

### Change Log Protocol
**EVERY RESPONSE MUST:**
1. **START**: Read MEMORY_BANK.md for recent context
2. **LOG PROMPT**: Document the user's exact request/prompt in MEMORY_BANK.md immediately
3. **TRACK ACTIONS**: Log each action taken during the response as it happens
4. **UPDATE STATUS**: Document project status changes and decisions made
5. **RESOLVE ISSUES**: Note any problems encountered and their solutions
6. **END**: Complete MEMORY_BANK.md entry before finishing response

### R.P.E.R. Cycle - MANDATORY REVIEW REQUIREMENT
**THE REVIEW PHASE IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY:**
- Every Execute phase MUST be followed by a Review phase
- Review phase MUST include end-to-end functionality testing
- Review phase MUST use Puppeteer for actual browser testing of user flows
- Review phase MUST test ALL user paths and interactions for the implemented feature
- Review phase MUST identify and document any bugs or issues
- NO TASK IS COMPLETE until Review phase validates functionality
- If bugs are found during Review, return to Execute phase to fix them

**PUPPETEER TESTING REQUIREMENT:**
- Navigate to the application using mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate
- Take screenshots at key steps using mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_screenshot  
- Click buttons and interact with forms using mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_click and mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_fill
- Verify that each user flow works completely without errors
- Document any console errors or visual issues discovered

### Documentation Enforcement Checklist
**BEFORE SENDING ANY RESPONSE:**
- [ ] MEMORY_BANK.md updated with current user prompt
- [ ] All actions and decisions logged in real-time
- [ ] FILE_GLOSSARY.md updated if files created/modified
- [ ] PROJECT_DESIGN.md updated if requirements changed
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated if phases completed

### Documentation Failure Recovery
**IF DOCUMENTATION WAS MISSED:**
