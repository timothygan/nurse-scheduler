# Memory Bank - Nurse Scheduler

## Purpose
This file tracks all completed tasks, decisions, and key insights to enable efficient context management and avoid redundant work.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Repository Setup and Optimization
**Original Prompt**: "init" and "Let's set up the repository optimally for you"

**Final Plan**:
1. Initialize git repository
2. Create CLAUDE.md with project context and AI workflow principles (updated to R.P.E.R.)
3. Create .gitignore for common Node.js patterns
4. Create README.md with basic project documentation
5. Separate Memory Bank and File Glossary into dedicated files

**Final Output**: 
- Git repository initialized
- Core project files created with R.P.E.R. workflow integration
- Structured documentation system established

**Key Insights**:
- Project is a nurse scheduling application
- Using R.P.E.R. cycle (Research, Plan, Execute, Review) for all tasks
- Maintaining separate files for memory bank and glossary improves organization
- Focus on context efficiency and avoiding redundant file reads

### Task 2: Project Requirements Analysis and Design
**Original Prompt**: Detailed explanation of nurse scheduling application requirements

**Project Scope**: 
Complex web application for nurse scheduling with two user types (schedulers and nurses), 4-week scheduling blocks, configurable hospital rules, and constraint-based schedule generation.

**Key Requirements Identified**:
- **Schedulers**: Define rules, create scheduling blocks, approve schedules
- **Nurses**: Submit preferences, request PTO/no-schedule days, view schedules
- **Complex Constraints**: Seniority bias, qualification matching, weekend requirements
- **Algorithm**: Constraint satisfaction problem with multiple valid solutions
- **Flexibility**: Different hospitals have different rules (configurable)

**Technology Stack Decisions**:
- Frontend: Next.js/React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js/Express with TypeScript  
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- Real-time: WebSockets

**Architecture**: 
- Multi-tenant (hospital-based)
- Role-based access control
- Custom constraint satisfaction scheduling engine
- API-first design with real-time collaboration

**Implementation Phases**:
1. Foundation (weeks 1-2): Project setup, auth, basic models
2. Rule Configuration (weeks 3-4): Scheduler interface
3. Nurse Preferences (weeks 5-6): Nurse interface  
4. Scheduling Engine (weeks 7-9): Core algorithms
5. Advanced Features (weeks 10-12): Real-time, analytics

**Key Insights**:
- This is a sophisticated constraint satisfaction problem
- Fairness vs. preferences requires careful optimization
- Seniority bias is critical for hospital acceptance
- Rule configurability is essential for different hospitals
- Real-time collaboration needed between schedulers and nurses

**Open Questions**:
- Shift type complexity and overlaps
- Granularity of qualifications/device training
- Integration with existing hospital systems
- Mobile usage patterns for nurses

### Task 3: Phase 1 Implementation - Foundation Setup
**Original Prompt**: Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and set up Prisma database layer

**Final Plan**:
1. Initialize Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
2. Install and configure Prisma with PostgreSQL
3. Design comprehensive database schema based on PROJECT_DESIGN.md models
4. Create database connection utilities and TypeScript types
5. Configure build pipeline and ESLint to work with generated code

**Final Output**:
- Next.js 15 project successfully initialized with modern stack
- Prisma 6.15.0 configured with complete database schema for nurse scheduling
- 8 core models defined: Hospital, User, NurseProfile, SchedulingBlock, NursePreferences, Schedule, ShiftAssignment
- TypeScript types created for business logic and database entities
- Build pipeline working correctly with proper ESLint configuration
- Ready for Phase 2 implementation

**Key Insights**:
- Next.js 15 with Turbopack provides fast development experience
- Prisma's type generation works well with TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint configuration needed adjustment to ignore generated Prisma files
- Database schema captures complex business requirements with JSON fields for flexibility
- Project structure aligns with planned architecture from design document

**Technical Decisions**:
- Used Prisma's `cuid()` for IDs instead of UUIDs for better performance
- Chose JSON fields for flexible data (rules, preferences, qualifications) 
- Implemented proper foreign key constraints with cascade deletes
- Used enums for constrained values (UserRole, ShiftType, etc.)
- Generated Prisma client to `src/generated/prisma` for clear separation

**Phase 1 Completion Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Project foundation established
- Database layer fully designed and configured
- TypeScript types defined
- Build system working correctly

**Date**: 2025-08-30

### Task 4: Phase 2 Planning and Critical Requirements Correction
**Original Prompt**: "What is your plan for phase 2 before you start executing?" followed by correction about scheduling period assumptions

**Research Conducted**:
- Reviewed PROJECT_DESIGN.md Phase 2 requirements
- Analyzed current database schema flexibility
- Identified Phase 2 deliverables and technical needs

**Critical Error Identified**:
- **Original Assumption**: All scheduling blocks are fixed 4-week periods
- **User Correction**: Scheduling periods should be **customizable per hospital** 
- **Impact**: Affects UI design, rule validation, and algorithm implementation

**Corrected Phase 2 Plan**:
1. **Authentication System** - NextAuth.js with role-based access
2. **Scheduler Dashboard** - Protected interface for scheduling management
3. **Scheduling Block Management** - **Customizable duration periods** (not fixed 4-week)
4. **Rule Configuration Engine** - Rules that adapt to different period lengths
5. **Nurse Profile Management** - CRUD interface for nurse data

**Technical Approach**:
- Date range picker with duration presets (1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, monthly, custom)
- Period-aware rule validation
- Database schema already supports flexibility with startDate/endDate

**Key Process Insight**:
- User emphasized the importance of updating PROJECT_DESIGN.md and MEMORY_BANK.md with ALL decisions and corrections in real-time
- Added documentation requirements to CLAUDE.md for systematic tracking

**Documentation Updates Made**:
- ✅ Updated PROJECT_DESIGN.md with scheduling period correction
- ✅ Added critical correction section with impact analysis  
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with documentation requirements
- ✅ This MEMORY_BANK.md entry documenting the conversation

## Key Decisions Made
- Chose to separate memory management into dedicated files rather than embedding in CLAUDE.md
- Implemented R.P.E. cycle as core workflow methodology
- Established File Glossary as primary reference before opening files
