# Memory Bank - Nurse Scheduler

## Purpose
This file tracks all completed tasks, decisions, and key insights to enable efficient context management and avoid redundant work.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Repository Setup and Optimization
**Original Prompt**: "init" and "Let's set up the repository optimally for you"

**Final Plan**:
1. Initialize git repository
2. Create CLAUDE.md with project context and AI workflow principles
3. Create .gitignore for common Node.js patterns
4. Create README.md with basic project documentation
5. Separate Memory Bank and File Glossary into dedicated files

**Final Output**: 
- Git repository initialized
- Core project files created with R.P.E. workflow integration
- Structured documentation system established

**Key Insights**:
- Project is a nurse scheduling application
- Using R.P.E. cycle (Research, Plan, Execute) for all tasks
- Maintaining separate files for memory bank and glossary improves organization
- Focus on context efficiency and avoiding redundant file reads
